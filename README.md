# AIO Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

All in One Discord.js v13 Bot | Music, Radio, Game Stats & more.

I created this bot to learn more Javascript. As of today the bot has over 105.000 users.
## Running the bot

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rico-vz/aio-discord-bot
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd aio-discord-bot
```

Install all the dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

Install FFmpeg https://ffmpeg.org/download.html


Edit the config to match your bots authentication information

Now run the but using

```bash
  node bot.js
```

You can now see the bot online in your Discord server(s).
I recommend using PM2 (https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) for automatic restarts and log collection.
